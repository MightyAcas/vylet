# LY Workman

In case you were wondering, the bulk of Vylet’s SFBs comes from these combinations: LY, NY, UE, SC, and OA. All of these combos are very comfortable to type with LY being less comfortable because the movement from L to Y is diagonal. Some people might say that this is a very bad thing but in reality it is not. First, LY occurs at about 0.24% of the time on average. That’s less than a quarter of one percent. To put it into perspective, for every 10,000 keystrokes, you will type LY only 24 times. At this rate, you will not even notice it. Even with this extra 0.24% considered, Workman’s diagonal movements are still greater than Vylet’s. Second, even though it’s a diagonal motion, you’re not really coping that much because when you type L, you move your hand slightly to the side so that your middle finger is about to hit it (storing potential energy), then you release it to type L, followed by Y with your index. The stretch is about the same as when you come from home row. It’s even less when you use a matrix style keyboard. Third, LY occurs at the end of the word almost all the time. This is important and it makes a huge difference. This means that when you type LY, you do it at the end of the flow of a word as a finishing stroke instead of being in the middle, which makes it less cumbersome. All in all, I don’t think this is a big deal.
